				<p>The exhibition <a href="">Visitors to Versailles</a>, a collaboration between the Palace of Versailles and The Met, includes rare and glorious examples of the finest court dress from eighteenth-century Europe; indeed, the exquisiteness of Versailles was matched only by the sumptuous finery of palace visitors in their silken and gilt ensembles. But while the exhibition visitors might swoon at the evocative costumes promenading through the galleries, they might not be familiar with the complex, behind-the-scenes efforts of the Costume Institute installation and conservation teams to prepare the garments for display.</p>
				<p>Several of the costumes on display come from the Costume Institute's own exceptional holdings. Two objects, the <a href="">British man's</a> traveling suit and the tricorne hat, were included in the exhibition when it was held at Versailles earlier this year, while others, like two stunning pink dresses and a richly embroidered man's court suit, can only be seen in The Met's staging of the exhibition.</p>
				<p>Prior to exhibiting any fashionable ensemble, the Costume Institute's conservators carefully examine and treat the objects so that they can be displayed safely and beautifully. The most intensive treatment for this exhibition was executed by <a href="">Costume Institute Conservation Fellow Marina Hays</a>, whose fellowship research examined conservation methods for eighteenth-century dresses and thus aligned perfectly with the objects to be exhibited. Marina studied, conserved, and dressed the two Costume Institute dresses in the show: both the more formal robe à la française and the less formal robe à l'anglaise.</p>
				<p><img src="https://www.metmuseum.org/-/media/images/blogs/now-at-the-met/2018/2018_07/the-costume-institute-visitors-to-versailles/the-costume-institute_visitors-to-versailles_installation_6xl.jpg?as=1&mh=1856&mw=2320&hash=9BA2C6EFC6288E8B344B067DA063DF57BB0C6ABD" alt=""></p>
				<p>The conservators were particularly curious about the types of dye that had been used to create the dresses' brilliant pink colors. Nobuko Shibayama, <a href="">Research Scientist in the Department of Scientific Research</a>, analyzed the dye for both dresses and found that the robe à la française had been dyed with safflower, which means the dress likely used to be an even brighter pink. The striped robe à l'anglaise had been dyed with orchil, a dye that comes from lichen. The pink stripes had possibly once been a more lavender color, but shifted over time to appear pinker. These scientific findings also showed that the natural dyes in both garments are very sensitive to light, which allowed the <a href="">Costume Institute's</a> conservators to recommend, with confidence, very low light levels within the galleries to prevent further fading.</p>

				<p>There were areas in the man's court suit that needed to be stabilized before it could be dressed and displayed. Although the suit reads as brown, it is a voided silk velvet consisting of red ground fabric (which has faded to pink in areas) with fine stripes of black pile. The silk-velvet fabric at the shoulder required some stitch repairs, as did the lining. The buttons of the waistcoat (a.k.a. vest) also needed some love, not only to disguise existing distracting damage, but also to prevent further abrasion and loss of fibers to the delicate covered buttons. Silk underlays were used to fill in the losses, and a fine net overlay was laid over the top for protection.</p>

				<p>It's common for ensembles dating from more than two hundred years ago to have lost some of their elements before coming into the Museum's collection. Showing incomplete ensembles can be distracting to the viewers, as well as inaccurate, so we often complete the total look with non-accessioned accessories, either antiques or made new. For example, our British man's traveling suit consists only of a frock coat and breeches, but the Museum's curators decided that the gentleman would also have worn a waistcoat. Joyce Fung, the Costume Institute's Senior Research Associate for Installation, sewed a new one, based on a historical pattern, using a heathered-wool fabric (sourced from New York City's garment district) that closely matched the color and texture of the original. Additional items were added for the installation, including a vintage cravat and cuffs, and reproduction shoes and stockings.</p>

				<p>The team also carried out microfading analysis, an analytical technique that compares the rate of fading induced on the object in an area less than .3 millimeters wide (about the size of the tip of a pin) to known rates of fading for textiles. The results of this test indicated that the dye is indeed light sensitive, so the suit must always be displayed under low light levels and with great care. What our visitors may not notice is that the Museum's excellent lighting team has established the lighting levels throughout the exhibition galleries so that they lower gradually. By the time Franklin's suit comes into view, visitors' eyes have adjusted to the very low light levels that ensure the suit's preservation.</p>
				<p>Besides conservation treatments, scientific testing, and fashionable styling, the biggest costume challenge was logistical: finding the space to temporarily mount and store these huge gowns. The Museum's Registrar and Exhibition offices worked closely with the Costume Institute team and the lenders to make sure that the installation went smoothly. Once all of the objects and their couriers had arrived, we took over the area that is now the exhibition's retail shop, creating a satellite lab that could accommodate important conservation processes, such as condition reporting and dressing.</p>
				<p>Even more challenging was choreographing the installation of the huge costume case that greets all of our visitors—before the case could be closed, every single lender had to be present, along with the Costume Institute's conservation and installation teams, other conservators from around the Museum who were helping with the doll and the weapons, the curators, and all of the other people who make our exhibitions such a success—the project managers, registrars, mount makers, riggers, technicians, and more. As our ace plexiglass team—which is responsible for closing and opening all vitrines throughout the Museum—put the last plexiglass panel into place, we all breathed a sigh of relief and stood back to marvel at the glorious ensembles parading before us.</p>
